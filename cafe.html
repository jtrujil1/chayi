                <p>A blend of spring-harvested green tea from Hubei, China scented with fresh jasmine flower grown in Fujian, China. This aromatic blend seamlessly combines the two flavors for a blend greater than the sum of its parts.</p>

                <h3>Emerald Spring</h3>
                <p>From Hubei, China the birthplace of the steaming process most commonly used to produce Japanese green tea. It is steamed and pan-fired and highlights flavors from both processes. The flavor is sweet and vibrant, with a buttery, nuttiness.</p>
