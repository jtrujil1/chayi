            <p class="text">
                The Chinese character for tea is 茶, pronounced chayi. 
                The Hindi word for tea is चाय, pronounced chaay. 
                The Russian word for tea is чай, pronounced chay. 
                Across cultures, generations, 
                and even civilizations, tea has acted as a drink 
                that brings individuals together, a token of welcoming. 
                Here at Chayi House, we have the same intention. Based on a 
                culture of service, we promise to give you an experience filled 
                with not only world-class tea, but one where you feel 
                well-rested and reenergized.

                Our teas come from all over the world: China, India, Southeast Asia, 
                Europe, and more, but our home is in Somerville. You can find our chayi 
                café at Davis Square in Somerville. We first open two years ago, and 
                we are a bustling spot for college students, Boston commuters, and 
                morning runs. We are in the works of opening new locations across MA.
